# 0x09. Implement a design from scratch


In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. 
You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously. 
You won‚Äôt have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.
Here the final result:

Important notes with Figma:
  + if your computer doesn‚Äôt have missing fonts, you can find them here: [source-sans-pro](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/wltHny-KZP3B8JFRvpmVjA) and [Spin-Cycle-OT](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/Qb96K4nTPQJO1paP_OBELw)
  + some values are in float - feel free to round them

For this task, please write an amazing `README.md`

**Interactions note:**
  + the web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less
  + links hover/active: `#FF6565`
  + button hover/active: `opacity: 0.9`
  + max width of the content: 1000px centered in the page


## 1. Header
Building a web page the right way, is not easy - expect if you put in place strong foundations:

Building a web page the right way, is not easy - expect if you put in place strong foundations:
  + reset CSS styling
  + use variables
  + simple/‚Äúas generic as you can‚Äù CSS selectors
  + avoid using super specific CSS selectors as much as possible
  + simple HTML structure - `div` containers are your friend!

Last advice: Personally, I always start to build a web page from outside to inside and from top to bottom. 
But you can try to other way - it‚Äôs fine - but you should structure the way that you will implement a component and not get lost with HTML tags.

Now, your turn!

For this first task: **create the header/hero piece**

Here an archive of all assets needed: [images_0x09.zip](https://holbertonintranet.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/misc/2020/3/d1597894d79386c83b9b.zip?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUWMNL5ANN%2F20210823%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20210823T154022Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=345600&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Signature=52c998e3d01e6462b580e530ec54df81d9c59eb4eaf749231fca332fce01006f)

Copy files from the previous task.

For this second task: **create the ‚ÄúWhat we do‚Ä¶‚Äù section**

In this section, you will need custom font icons. Here the archive of it: [holberton_school-icon.zip](https://holbertonintranet.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/misc/2020/3/7159d988278de54d859d.zip?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUWMNL5ANN%2F20210823%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20210823T154022Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=345600&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Signature=eb6003fe6d799948d2a32c49f8aed0192e027483ae254a7fbf07308491dbd38a)

Inside you will find demo page of how to use it.

**Important:** try to build as generic as you can‚Ä¶ you will probably need some components in next section.


## 3. "Our results" section
